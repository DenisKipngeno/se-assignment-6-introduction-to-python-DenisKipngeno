# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

# 1. Python Basics: What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
### Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and versatility. Developed by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability and simplicity, using significant whitespace.
## **Key Features:*
#### i) Easy to Learn and Use: Python has a simple syntax that mimics natural language, making it easy to learn for beginners and enabling developers to write clean and readable code.
#### ii) Interpreted Language: Python code is executed line-by-line, which makes debugging easier.
#### iii) Dynamically Typed: Python does not require the declaration of data types for variables, allowing for more flexibility.
#### iv) Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a large standard library that includes modules and packages for various tasks like web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more.
#### v) Cross-Platform: Python is available on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
#### vi) Community Support: Python has a large and active community, which contributes to a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks.
## *Use Cases:*
#### i) Web Development: Using frameworks like Django and Flask.
#### ii) Data Analysis and Visualization: Using libraries like pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
#### iii) Machine Learning and AI: Using libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn.
#### iv) Automation and Scripting: Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
#### v) Software Development: Building desktop and mobile applications.

# 2. Installing Python: Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
## i) Download Python:
#### Go to the official Python website: (https://www.python.org/).
#### Download the latest version of Python for Windows.
## ii) Run the Installer:
#### Double-click the downloaded executable file.
#### Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH."
#### Click "Install Now" and follow the instructions.
## iii) Verify the Installation:
#### Open Command Prompt.
#### Type *python --version* and press Enter.
#### You should see the installed Python version.
## iv)Setting Up a Virtual Environment:
#### Open Command Prompt.
#### Navigate to your project directory.
#### Run the following commands:
##### *python -m venv myenv*
##### **myenv\Scripts\activate*
#### To deactivate the virtual environment, run:
##### **deactivate*

# 3. Python Syntax and Semantics: Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
### *Simple Python Program*
##### print("Hello, World!")
### *Explanation:*
##### print(): A built-in function that outputs the specified message to the console.
##### "Hello, World!": A string literal, enclosed in double quotes, which is the message to be printed.

# 4. Data Types and Variables: List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
## Basic Data Types:
#### i) int: Integer numbers, e.g., 5
#### ii) float: Floating-point numbers, e.g., 3.14
#### iii) str: String literals, e.g., "hello"
#### iv) bool: Boolean values, e.g., True or False
#### v) list: Ordered, mutable collections, e.g., [1, 2, 3]
#### vi) tuple: Ordered, immutable collections, e.g., (1, 2, 3)
#### vii)dict: Key-value pairs, e.g., {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
## Script Demonstrating Variables:
 #### Integer
##### x = 5
##### print(x)
#### Float
##### y = 3.14
##### print(y)
#### String
##### name = "Alice"
##### print(name)
#### Boolean
##### is_student = True
##### print(is_student)
#### List
##### numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
##### print(numbers)
#### Tuple
##### coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
##### print(coordinates)
#### Dictionary
##### person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
##### print(person)

# 5. Control Structures: Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
### Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute certain parts of your code based on specific conditions. The primary conditional statements are if, elif, and else.
### Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is met. Python supports for and while loops.
## 'if-else'Statement:
#### age = 18
#### if age >= 18:
####    print("You are an adult.")
#### else:
####    print("You are a minor.")
## 'for 'Loop:
#### for i in range(5):
####     print(i)

# 6. Functions in Python: What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
### Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code, reducing redundancy, and improving readability.
## Function Example:
#### def add(a, b):
####     return a + b
## Calling the function
#### result = add(3, 5)
#### print(result) 

# 7. Lists and Dictionaries: Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
## Differences:
#### List: Ordered collection, indexed by position, mutable.
#### Dictionary: Unordered collection, indexed by keys, mutable.
## Script Example:
#### *List*
##### numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
##### numbers.append(6)
##### print(numbers) 
#### *Dictionary*
#### person = {"name": "Denis", "age": 21}
#### person["email"] = "denis@example.com"
#### print(person)  Output: {'name': 'Denis', 'age': 21, 'email': 'denis@example.com'}

# 8. Exception Handling: What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
### Exception handling is a way to handle errors or exceptions that occur during the execution of a program, ensuring that the program can continue running or terminate gracefully.
## Example:
#### try:
####     x = 10 / 0
#### except ZeroDivisionError as e:
 ####   print(f"Error: {e}")
#### finally:
 ####    print("This block always executes.")

# 9. Modules and Packages: Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
### Module: A single file containing Python code, which can be imported and used in other scripts.
### Package: A collection of related modules, organized in directories.
## Example:
#### import math
## Using a function from the math module
#### result = math.sqrt(16)
#### print(result)  # Output: 4.0

# 10. File I/O: How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
## Reading from a File:
#### with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
####     content = file.read()
####     print(content)
## Writing to a File:
#### lines = ["First line\n", "Second line\n", "Third line\n"]
#### with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
####     file.writelines(lines)
# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
